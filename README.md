# Sign-Sense: Sign Language Detection Application

There are **More than 70 million** deaf people around the world use sign languages to communicate. Sign-Sense is designed to recognize sign language gestures and convert them into text language, aiding communication for the hearing impaired. It is a sign language detection application that uses key points of action to make predictions using Mediapipe, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.  Currently, the application can detect and interpret three fundamental sign language actions: "Hello," "Thank You," and "I Love You." Due to hardware restrictions, the model is trained on fewer epochs and is limited in the number of actions it can recognize, but future updates will expand its capabilities.

* **Action Recognition:** Identify and interpret specific sign language actions such as "Hello," "Thank You," and "I Love You."
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction and testing.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* MediaPipe

## Data Collection
The data for training the Sign-Sense model was collected using Mediapipe and stored as NumPy arrays by Myself. The key points of action were extracted and used to train the LSTM and dense layers of the TensorFlow model.

Also I've uploaded the training dataset. You can download it [![By Clicking Here](https://img.shields.io/badge/By_Clicking-Here-blue)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fwzSxWTl8DvNFUHUSytsZYEfb0512PBR?usp=sharing)

## Future Improvements
* **Hardware Expansion:** Increase hardware capabilities for training on larger datasets and recognizing more sign language actions.
* **Model Refinement:** Train the model on more epochs and fine-tune hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
* **Action Expansion:** Add support for recognizing a wider range of sign language gestures beyond the current three actions.
* **Refined Codebase:** The Codebase will be refined by using a modular codebase and a training pipeline will be implemented which can be used to train further actions.
